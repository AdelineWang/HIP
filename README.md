In summer 2014, I completed the High School Summer Internship Program (HIP) at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. I contributed worked in Dr. Rich Sutton's lab in computer science under Dr. Joseph Modayil. The area of research was artificial intelligence in robots. 
The intent of the project is to evaluate a collaborative human-robot control system by determining how much distance it travels in a constant environment compared to two other systems. In this system a person provides commands to the robot through a gamepad controller. The robot learns to predit bumper colisions and turns when an imminent collusion is predicted.
